# Mobile-Sales-Analysis-DataDNA-May-2025-Challenge
## 🧾 Project Overview
This project was built as part of the May 2025 DataDNA Challenge, where I worked as a data analyst for a major mobile phone retailer operating across multiple countries. Using a comprehensive 2024 mobile phone sales dataset, I explored product performance, customer preferences, and regional sales trends to generate actionable business insights and build a story-driven dashboard.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
1. Analyze mobile sales patterns across regions and cities.
2. Identify top-selling brands, models, and specifications (storage, color, OS).
3. Understand customer demographics by device type (age group, gender).
4. Evaluate sales channels (online, in-store, partners) and payment methods.
5. Uncover monthly trends and regional pricing/sales variations.
6. Discover correlations between customer demographics and product preferences.

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques Used
Power BI Desktop
Power Query for data cleaning
Data modeling with relationships (star schema)
DAX measures for KPIs
Excel for initial exploration (optional)
Structured Problem-Solving Approach to address each business question
